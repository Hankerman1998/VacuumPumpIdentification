# VacuumPumpIdentification
this is a MATLAB program for identifying characteristics of a vacuum pump based on a pumpdown curve

The repo has a 
1) main script for identifying the parameters of a vacuum pump (identification.m)
2) an auxillary function for simulating the pump down of a constant volume chamber
3) an auxillary function describing the pump speed vs. pump pressure
4) a test file with a pumpdown curve from a real pump

Just copy the files to some folder, direct MATLAB overthere and run the main identification script.
The program requires an optimization toolbox.
